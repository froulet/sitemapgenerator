# sitemapgenerator
Lightweight PHP app to help you generate a sitemap of all the files on your server.

Simply put the extracted directory at the root of your server (usually 'www' or 'public_html').

Then just launch 'index.php' file.

If the execution fails, some settings can be changed in 'Config/config.php'.
